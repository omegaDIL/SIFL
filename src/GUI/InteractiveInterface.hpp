/**
 * \brief  Manages an interface with changeable contents: texts and shapes.
 * 
 * Interactive elements are designed to respond to mouse hover events. When an element is hovered,
 * the `eventUpdateHovered` function returns a pointer to it.
 * Buttons are a special type of interactive element with an attached function. This function is
 * triggered when the button is pressed.
 * For writing texts, you can access `exitWritingCharacter` which tells what character stops the 
 * writing (enter by default), or `emptinessWritingCharacters` which enters a string if the writing 
 * text is empty when the user exits it (`"0"` by default).
 * 
 * Once you have added all your elements, you can lock the interface to avoid futur modifications.
 * Locking reduces time consumption of hover detection, and CAN reduce memory usage a little bit.
 * The locking state also ensure stability for pointers, hence you won't be able to use the move
 * functions. However, all pointers returned by getter functions will remain valid. The lock state
 * does not affect editing elements that are already added. 
 * You may not be able to lock the interface if you often add and remove elements. You can try to
 * hide them instead, but it is not always the best way. Sometimes removing elements can save memory.
 *
 * A code example is provided at the end of the file.
 *
 * \note This class stores UI components ; it will use a considerable amount of memory.
 * \note Each mutable elements might consume a little more memory than their fixed counterparts.
 *		 For Interactive elements, they are very memory efficient unless they have a button (see 
 *		 `std::function`)
 * \note Do not try to replicate the interactive feature: you WILL end up having very bad performances.
 *		 The functions `eventUpdateHovered` and `addInteractives` are, on the other hand, more optimized
 *		 for cache locality.
 * \warning Avoid deleting the `sf::RenderWindow` passed as an argument while this class is using it.
 * 
 * \see `MutableInterface`.

	 *			  For example, if `relativeScalingDefinition` is set to 1080:
